      <p>We aim to develop a game to help those who struggle to understand algebra. 
        Our game will be a turn-based, rogue-like adventure through algebra. 
        With dungeons, bosses, and power-ups all throughout, 
        you’ll be engaged in the world as much as you are with the math. 
        But be sure to calculate your next step carefully. Damage is dealt to the  
        reckless, and penalties will be incurred for wrong answers. 
        Find hints and collect extra lives to survive your mathematical journey.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Problem</u></h2>
    <p>Algebra, while being a very important skill that is the backbone of mathematics, is
      extremely difficult for the average person to understand.</p>

    <h2><u>Solution</u></h2>
    <p>A solo turn-based rogue-like game where the player adventures through
      dungeons, tackling enemies and increasing in power as you adventure along. The
      turn-based genre is particularly well-suited for incorporating combat into a math game
      as it gives the player time to think. Each turn could incentivize the player to think
      carefully about their moves by dealing damage for each turn the player takes. This
      means the player will want to defeat the enemies (solve the problems) in as few moves
      as possible. This both allows for fun optimization challenges while also incentivizing the
      players to learn and memorize algebraic techniques. Additional penalties would be
      given for incorrect answers. With regards to the rogue-like mechanics, these games are
      fun and popular, so that particular part isn't connected to algebra but instead focused on
      making the game fun and addictive. Enhancements and upgrades could be found to
      give hints or allow for more moves and tries when solving problems. Gamification is a
      powerful tool in education as it keeps engagement high while also knocking down the
      barrier to entry for complex topics.</p>
